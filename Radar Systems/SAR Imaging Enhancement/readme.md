SAR Imaging & Range Migration Compensation (MATLAB)Designed a complete Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) processing pipeline for an X-band 10  GHz airborne system. 

Implemented Range Migration Compensation (RMC) to correct for range curvature errors exceeding 50 m (100+ range bins). 

Achieved a Focusing Gain of +23.5 dB, successfully compressing dispersed energy (Peak: 6.6) into a coherent point target (Peak: 100.0), validating the phase correction algorithm. 

Demonstrated end-to-end image formation including Doppler Beam Sharpening (DBS) and Azimuth Compression.
